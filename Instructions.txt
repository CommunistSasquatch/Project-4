Due:
Create the logic for the dice game Pig, in which a player can compete with the computer. The object of the game is to be the first to score 100 points. The user and computer take turns rolling a pair of dice following these rules: 

• On a turn, each player rolls two dice.
If no 1 appears, the dice values are added to a running total for the turn
and the player can choose whether to roll again or pass the turn to the other player.
• If a 1 appears on one of the dice, nothing more is added to the player’s game total for that turn, and it becomes the other player’s turn. 
• If a 1 appears on both of the dice, not only is the player’s turn over, but the player’s entire accumulated total is reset to 0. 
• When the computer does not roll a 1 and can choose whether to roll again, generate a random value of 1 or 2. The computer will then decide to continue when the value is 1 and decide to quit and pass the turn to the player when the value is not 1.
